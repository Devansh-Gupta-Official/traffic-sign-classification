# Traffic Signs Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks

This project focuses on training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize traffic signs using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.

## Dataset Exploration
The dataset consists of:

1. Training Set: 34,799 images with corresponding labels.
2. Validation Set: A separate set for validating the model during training.
3. Test Set: For evaluating the model's performance after training.
